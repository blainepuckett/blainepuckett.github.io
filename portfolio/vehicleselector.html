                <h3>The Challenge</h3>
                <p>
                    Unlike other products, automotive parts and accessories need to be specified with fitment data so
                    that customers know if the part will fit their vehicle. Some parts have wide compatibility and other
                    parts only fit specific years, makes, and models.

                </p>
                <p>The challenge was to reduce the number of online returns by ensuring customers that they are
                    purchasing the correct parts for their vehicle.

                <p class="">With a focus on discoverability I went though many different iterations and ideas but
                    nothing tested well. Every solution was either too annoying or too subtle. Eventually I did hit upon

                    and then guide them through the process of adding a vehicle, showing them where to access their
                    virtual garage, and how to search for vehicle specific parts.</p>

                    vehicle” widget will appear as part of the page design.</p>

                <p>The bright color allows the widget to stand out without completely overshadowing the promotional
                    offer(s).

                <p>After the user inputs their vehicle information, the widget disappears, and a success notification is
                    shown below the vehicle selector dropdown.
                </p>

                <p>This confirms the successful input of vehicle data and draws the user’s eye to the vehicle dropdown
                    and search functions which are the next steps in the path-to-purchase.
                </p>

                <p>By utilizing cookies or saving account data, the next time the user visits or logs in, they would not
                    see the widget and their most recent vehicle would be pre-selected in the dropdown.
                </p>

                <p>Repeated testing showed that removing the widget for returning users did not negatively impact the
                    usage of the feature. It also had the added benefit of returning visual precedence to the current
                    promotion(s).

                <p>If a user has a vehicle selected the PLP poses no problem because we filter search results based on
                    vehicle type. The primary challenge was to encourage users who didn’t have a vehicle selected to add
                    one. </p>
                <p>The solution was to mimic the homepage widget approach at the top of the search results while also
                    adding some helper text to each product description. The helper text explained why we wanted the
                    vehicle information, and the widget’s bright color gave users an easy way to do that without having
                    to navigate away.

                <h6 class="font-weight-bold">Product Description Page</h6>
                <p>The PDP solution had to account for 3 different scenarios: The product is a perfect fit. The product
                    does not fit, and we don’t know if the product fits because we have no vehicle information.</p>

                <p> By using the same helper text found in the PLP solution I was able to provide a consistent pattern
                    that users could recognize to ensure proper fitment consistently.
                </p>
                <p> For the scenarios where the part does not fit or is unknown, a red page banner is used to redirect
                    the user towards a compatible part or encourage them to input their vehicle information.

                    handle multiple vehicles and products at the same time, while providing clear compatibility details
                    for each product, and offer users an easy way to add or manage their vehicles. </p>
                <p> As shown in the example above, I ended up using the existing helper text and page banner patterns
                    already established. Testing had shown that this approach provided users with clear confirmation of
                    compatibility and gave them the confidence to complete their purchase.</p>

                <h5>Recap and Reflection</h5>
                <p class="">Making sure the customer gets the right part in the traditional store environment is easy.
                    When I started this project, giving them that same assurance online was much more difficult. Because
                    the vehicle information is so important for the customer’s experience the amount of effort and time
                    put into this was considerable. While you always hope for the best, the results were well beyond
                    even my wildest of expectations.

                </p>
                <p>
                    The first few months after these features were implemented, we saw a 72% increase in vehicle
                    selector engagement and an 85% reduction in online returns caused by improper fitment. In the time
                    that has passed all of the other major auto parts retailers have adopted a similar approach to
                    solving these problems.
